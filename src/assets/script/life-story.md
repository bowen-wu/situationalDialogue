## project

- Hi, Kim, I can't believe that the summer is almost over. (嗨，金姆。我真不能相信这个夏天就要过去了。)

* I know. Time files! (是啊。光阴似箭。)

- Friday is holiday. Let's take advantage of the long weekend /wiːkˈɛnd/ . Do you want to go to New York? We could leave Thursday night and spend the whole weekend /wiːkˈɛnd/ in the city. (星期五房价，让我们好好利用一下这个长周末。想不想去纽约？我们可以星期四晚上走，整个周末都待在那里。)

* Okay. But Ｉ'd ranther go on Friday. I have to get my car fixed on Thursday. (好啊，不过我想星期五走，我星期四把车修好。)

- All right. We can take turns driving. (好吧，我们可以轮流开车。)

* Fine. We won't get so tired that way. (不错，这样我们就不会太累。)

- I'm looking forword to seeing New York. I've never been there, but I have always wanted to go. (我真盼望看到纽约啊。我从来没有去过，但是一直就想去。)

* I haven't either. Let's make the most of our weekend /wiːkˈɛnd/. (我也是，让我们尽情享受周末吧。)

- We can go sightseeing during the day. In the evening we can go to a play. Do you think we can get tickets? (我们白天可以去观光。晚上就去看表演，你说我们会买到票吗？)

* I don't think we stand a chance /tʃæns/. It's hard to get tickets on weekends. Anyway, we can try. (我想我们买不到，周末买票太难了，不管怎样，还是试一下吧。)

## pay a visit

- Linda, it's so great to see you again! (琳达，再次见到你真是太高兴了！)

* Well, thanks for inviting me to lunch. I never seem to leave my house these days! (谢谢你邀我吃午饭。我这些天几乎没有出过门！)

- Come in, please. Make yourself at home. (请进，随便点，别客气。)

* Thanks. You have a beautiful place. (谢谢，你这地方真漂亮。)

- I'm glad you like it. The furniture /'fɝnɪtʃɚ/ is in pretty /ˈprɪtɪ/ bad condition, though. We should get rid of it. It really looks bad in this new house. (很高兴你喜欢，尽管家具很糟糕。我们应该丢掉它，新房子里放旧家具实在有些难看。)

* Don't do that. It's very comfortable. You have children, don't you? (别丢，家具挺舒适的。你有孩子吧？)

- Yes, we do. Two boys and a girl. Not to mention /'mɛnʃən/ two dogs and a cat. So we have to make do with this furniture. As long as the children are small, anyway. It doesn't make sence /sɛns/ to replace it. (是啊。两个男孩和一个女孩。并且还有两只狗和一只猫，就是因为孩子们太小了，所以我们不得不留着这些家居。丢掉了没有多大意义。)

* I know what you mean. Our children are hard on furniture, too. They are always jumping up and down on the sofa or spilling /spɪl/ food on my chairs. (我懂你的意思。我家孩子也是不爱惜家具。他们总是在沙发上蹦来蹦去，要不就把饭洒在椅子上。)

- They sound just like my children. (他们跟我的孩子们查不了多少。)

* Maybe we should get them all together to play with each other some afternoon. (也许我们该找一个下午让他们聚在一起玩一玩。)

- That's a great idea! (这个主意可真好。)
