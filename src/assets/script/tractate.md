## Koko, the Gorilla /ɡə'rɪlə/ [大猩猩] Who Knew Sign Language, Dies

- Koko, the gorilla who became famous for learning sign language, has died in the United /jʊ'naɪtɪd/ States.

* The California-based Gorilla Foundation that kept /kɛpt/ and studied /'stʌdɪd/ Koko announced /ə'naunst/ that she had passed away in her sleep on Tuesday. She was 46 years old.

- "Koko touched the lives of millions as an ambassador /æm'bæsədɚ/ for all gorillas and an icon for interspecies /intə'spi:ʃi:z/ communication and empathy," the foundation said in a statement." She was beloved and will be deeply missed."

* Koko was a western /'wɛstɚn/ lowland gorilla born on July /dʒʊˈlaɪ/ 4, 1971 at the San Francisco /fræn'siskəu/ Zoo. The very next year, Koko began working with Dr. Francine /fræn'si:n/ Patterson, who taught /tɔt/ her American Sign Language. Her keepers said Koko also understood some spoken English.

- The teaching experiment /ɪk'sperɪmənt/ became part of a larger project at California's Stanford /'stænfəd/ University in 1974. The Stanford project later expanded /ɪk'spændɪd/ to include another western lowland gorilla, named Michael, who also learned sign language.

* Five years later, the Gorilla Foundation was created in the Santa /'sæntə/ Cruz Mountains /'maʊntəns/, about 40 kilometers south /saʊθ/ of San Francisco /fræn'siskəu/. The two gorilla were moved there. Michael deid in 2000.

- Another gorilla named Ndume lived with Koko at the foundation. Researchers /'rɪsɜtʃəz/ say he does not have the same sign language abilities as Koko and Michael.

* Koko appeared in many films and televesion documentaries. She appeared twice /twaɪs/ in the magazine National Geographic /,dʒiə'ɡræfɪk/. Her 1978 cover showed a photograph Koko and taken of herself in a mirror.

- The second issue /'ɪʃu/, in 1985, included the story of Koko and her pet /pɛt/ cat, named All Ball. The story led to the popular /'pɑpjəlɚ/ book "Koko's Kotten," which can be found in many schools worldwide.

* In 1998, Koko appeared on the internet in what researchers called the first "interspecies chat." The gorilla used the event to communicate through an interpreter to directly /dəˈrɛktli/ answer /'ænsɚ/ questions from fans.

- In 2001, Koko got publicity /pʌb'lɪsəti/ again when actor /'æktɚ/ Robin Willams went to visit her and talked about how moved he was by the experience /ɪk'spɪrɪəns/." We shared something extraordinary - laughter /'læftɚ/," the late actor said at the time.

* Western lowland gorillas are threatened /'θrɛtnd/ in their native environment /ɪn'vaɪrənmənt/ of central Africa /ˈæfrɪkə/.

- The Gorilla Foundation says it will continue to honor /ɑnɚ/ Koko by continuing /kən'tɪnjʊɪŋ/ to carry out ongoing projects. These include conservation efforts /ɛfɚts/ in Africa and expanding /ɪk'spændɪŋ/ the Maui /'maui/ Great Ape /ep/ Sanctuary /'sæŋktʃuɛri/ in Hawaii /hə'waii:/.

* In addition, the foundation says it plans to create a sign language computer app including Koko that is designed to help gorillas and children alike.
